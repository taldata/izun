# Summary of Database Separation Changes

## ✅ What Was Done

Your application now has **separate databases for local development and production** on Render, preventing production database overwrites during deployments.

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `database.py`
- ✅ Now uses `DATABASE_PATH` environment variable
- ✅ Falls back to `committee_system.db` for local development
- ✅ Automatically creates directory for database if it doesn't exist

### 2. `render.yaml`
- ✅ Added **persistent disk** configuration (1GB)
- ✅ Disk mounted at `/var/data`
- ✅ Set `DATABASE_PATH=/var/data/committee_system.db` for production

### 3. `.gitignore`
- ✅ Added all database files (*.db, *.sqlite, etc.)
- ✅ Your local database won't be committed to git anymore

### 4. `migrate_db.py` (NEW)
- ✅ Created migration script for deployments
- ✅ Uses same environment variable configuration
- ✅ Runs automatically during Render build

### 5. `README.md`
- ✅ Added warnings about database setup
- ✅ Updated deployment instructions
- ✅ References new documentation

## 📚 Documentation Created

### 1. `DATABASE_SETUP.md` (Quick Start)
- Quick reference guide
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Verification commands
- Backup instructions

### 2. `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (Detailed)
- Complete technical documentation
- Migration instructions for existing data
- Troubleshooting guide
- Best practices

## 🗄️ Current Database Status

Your local database files:
- ✅ `committee_system.db` (92KB) - **Will remain on your local machine only**
- ✅ `database.sqlite` (empty) - **Will be ignored**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
# Your local database should still work
python app.py
# Should connect to: committee_system.db
```

### 2. Commit and Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Separate local and production databases with persistent disk"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify on Render
After deployment, open Render Shell and run:
```bash
echo $DATABASE_PATH
# Should show: /var/data/committee_system.db

ls -lh /var/data/committee_system.db
# Should show the production database file
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Database Files Won't Be Committed
Your local database files are now gitignored and **will not be pushed to Git**. This is intentional and correct!

### Production Database Location
- **Before**: Database was in the app directory (ephemeral, got overwritten)
- **After**: Database is on persistent disk at `/var/data/` (persists across deployments)

### What Happens on Next Deployment
1. Your code changes are deployed
2. The persistent disk stays intact
3. The production database is **NOT** affected
4. Migration script runs to update schema if needed

## 🔍 Verify Everything Is Working

### Before Pushing
- [x] `.gitignore` updated
- [x] `database.py` uses environment variable
- [x] `render.yaml` has persistent disk config
- [x] `migrate_db.py` exists
- [x] Documentation created

### After Deployment
- [ ] Render shows persistent disk attached
- [ ] Environment variable `DATABASE_PATH` is set
- [ ] Production database exists at `/var/data/committee_system.db`
- [ ] Application works correctly
- [ ] Data persists after redeployment

## 🆘 If You Have Existing Production Data

If you already have production data on Render that you want to keep:

### Before Deploying These Changes
1. **Download the current production database**
   ```bash
   # In Render Shell
   cat committee_system.db > /tmp/backup.db
   ```
   
2. **Store it safely** on your local machine

### After Deploying These Changes
1. **Upload to persistent disk**
   ```bash
   # In Render Shell
   # Upload your backup file first, then:
   mv backup.db /var/data/committee_system.db
   ```

2. **Restart the service** from Render dashboard

**All changes are backward compatible** - your local development environment continues to work as before, and production now has persistent storage! 🎉
